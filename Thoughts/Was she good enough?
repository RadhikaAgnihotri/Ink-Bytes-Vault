.....

She failed miserably, not doing well,
But why and with whom was she comparing herself?
Her mistakes, were they so grave and forbidden,
That she was not worthy to be forgiven?

She wondered what will bring out the best in her,
Constant thrashing, guilt trips, abuse, and insult,
Or bits of motivation, unconditional support,
Love unwavering, an unsinkable boat.

After all, it was time to address,
The most crucial question, no more duress.
In her mind it lingered, kept her awake,
One she sought answers for, her heart at stake.

"In others' eyes," she searched, feeling small,
"Am I good enough?" The question, her call.
But if she shifted her mind, the truth, so clear,
"Yes, you are!" Always have been, without fear.

P.S
Tell me, dear listener, was she truly fine?
Did you find echoes of your own design?
If she shone bright, who shall inform her so?
For now, let's cherish quietly, ere this moment we outgrow.
