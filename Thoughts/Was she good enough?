After all, it was time to address,
The most crucial question, no more duress.
In her mind it lingered, kept her awake,
One she sought answers for, her heart at stake.

"Am I good enough?" The question, her call.
But if she shifted her mind, the truth, so clear,
"Yes, you are!" Always have been, without fear.
