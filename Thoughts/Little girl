The love you're looking for,
is buried deep within you.
And you will always going to need it,
I wish you always knew.

Now I am not saying that,
things will always work out,
but you little girl,
put up a fight, on yourself, never doubt.

I know when you grow up,
you will want others to love you,
treat you like you want,
but little girl, believe me,
only you can love yourself like that,
& that will make you strong!

I will always read these lines to you,
before going to bed,
because hey little girl,
I am your elder self.
