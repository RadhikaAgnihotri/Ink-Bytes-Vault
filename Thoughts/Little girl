The love you're looking for,
is buried deep within you.
And you are always going to need it,
I wish you always knew.
                     
Somedays your loved ones turn you down,
Somedays a stranger may help you out,
You must always remember then, that
Its God and yourself, you always got.
   
You can tell yourself the things you've been wanting to hear,
Treat yourself the way you want to be treated,
Love yourself so loudly,
It blocks all the negativity.
  
It is okay that others have a bag of conditions,
Before they invest in you,
But you give yourself that unconditional,
Support, hope, strength, love, dipped in divine fondue.

Now I am not saying that,
things will always work out,
but you little girl,
put up a fight, on yourself, never doubt.

I know when you grow up,
You will want others to love you,
treat you like you want,
But little girl, believe me,
only you can love yourself like that,
& that will make you strong!

I will always read these lines to you,
before going to bed,
because hey little girl,
I am your elder self.
