The constant threat to my respect,
Oh, the mood swings,
Makes me do things I regret,
And say words that cut and sting!  

If you can assassinate her character,
It's fine if she remains quiet, 
and throw shade at her entire being,
but a.h.b.l when she bites.  

We've all been through situations where,
being a woman just felt wrong,
when something that's empowering
made you weak instead of strong!

So I turned to her, I turned to Him,
He showed me love, she blessed my skin.
It wasn't all about physical strength,
The will became stronger, though power mighty thin.

So I said He made it easy, He had a great plan,
When he made the Woman, he also made the Man!    #Implies as there will always be a right man, for that right woman!
