THE WINDS PICKED UP PACE,
THIS TIME, IT WAS A TOUGHER RACE,
A BETTER HUMAN, A BETTER PLACE, #means a better human is a better place for that soul
I'VE GOT TO FACE THE FACE ON THAT REFLECTING SPACE

THE START HAS TO BE YOU,
IN BETWEEN, THERE MAY BE FEW,
THE END WILL REVEAL THE TRUE,
I'VE GOT TO DO WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO

THE FORCES WHO WILL ALWAYS BE,
THE SOULS WHO WILL NEVER LEAVE,
NO DOUBT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE,
I'VE GOT TO BE WHAT I WAS MEANT TO BE
