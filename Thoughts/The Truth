The Truth...

Fear of getting started,
Afraid to say no,
Telling white lies,
And putting up with a fake show.

Ready to be harsh on your own self,
Failing to see the glow,
Appreciating things of little to no value,
Just to fit in this globe.

Are you really thinking you are here to stay,
Pleasing everyone only to be gone one day,
You are doing just fine whilst alive,
And after life will be just okay.

So please live and love,
The conditions are too pricey to say,
The Truth be told once again,
You never came here to always stay!
So why fit in anyway?
