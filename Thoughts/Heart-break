Heart break, the feeling of betrayal,
the feeling of lost faith,
when expections don't manifest,
and good things give distaste

A loved one said something rude,
A friend's broken promise,
A beloved left you on a lonely route,
A planet hit by a colossal comet.  

Heart break is not just metaphorocal,
it could manifest as something as real as pain,
as real as the dark clouds before rain, 

if you let it it will 
change the biology of the heart,
break those cells beyond repair,
leave a permanent scar
