I make tough decisions,
Some for the present, most for future me,
They make my present uncomfortable,
But in the long run, sweet fruits of toil I'll reap.

I deny myself the distractions' sway,
With steadfast focus on my goal each day.
I shall become a challenge for my own challenges,
Strength emanates from deep within my soul.

From the failures, I learnt some lessons wise and deep,
If in tough storms I can stand alone, Then so be it also in calm breeze
The noise around cannot sink in me,
I don't have to be th strongest,
I just have to be stronger than the old me
