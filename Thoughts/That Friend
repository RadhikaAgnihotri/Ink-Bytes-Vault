The one that lingers, near or far,
The steadfast presence, my evening star,
The whisperer behind my back,
Of good things and straight up facts...

The one who whispers love each day,
The one who'd speak to my lifeless clay,
The one who parted for her academic quest,   ## The one who left me for her studies,
Or the one who chose me over the rest.       ## Or the one who left her studies for me?

Lessons learnt ; times well spent
I am so grateful for that friend!

The one who thought was using me,
The one who felt used by me,
The one whom I left through my stupidity,
The one whom I didn't leave by my stupidity.

Sometimes quietness ; Sometimes a non-stop vent
I am so grateful for that friend!
I wish you knew, to me what it truly meant.
I hope you know, now, what it truly meant.

The one who wanted me always to tag along,
The one who made plans to me unknown,
The one whose weather maintained the bond,      ##weather means her mind/heart, when it felt like
The one who'd be there through a storm's mourn.

Friendships of my dreams, platonic bonds of present,
I am so thankful for that friend.
