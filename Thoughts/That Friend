The one that lingers, near or far,
The steadfast presence, my evening star,
The whisperer behind my back,
Of good things and straight up facts...

The one who whispers love each day,
The one who'd speak to my lifeless clay,
The one who parted for her academic quest,   ## The one who left me for her studies,
Or the one who chose me over the rest.       ## Or the one who left her studies for me?

Lessons learnt ; times well spent
I am so grateful for that friend!
