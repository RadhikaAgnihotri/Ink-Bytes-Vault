Dear Nature,
Have I ever thanked you enough,
No I don't think,
Since time immemorial,
In your love and care I sink.

You are so fragile,
Even the mountains break,
Yet so strong,
Your winds, blow me away...

You birth, nurture, sustain us all,
Cradle us in our lap,
In another moment you can snatch life away,
Proving that we never are here to stay
