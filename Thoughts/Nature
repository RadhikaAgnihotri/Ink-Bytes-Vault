Dear Nature,
Have I ever thanked you enough,
No I don't think,
Since time immemorial,
In your love and care I sink.

You are so fragile,
Even the mountains break,
Yet so strong,
Your winds, blow me away...

You birth, nurture, sustain us all,
Cradle us in our lap,
In another moment you can snatch life away,
Proving that we never are here to stay

The crashing of the waves,
Pitter-patter of the rain,
Gentle whistles of breeze, on a warm summer eve,
A remedy for my pain.

I am made from the earthy elements,
I will return to you,
In between these two moments,
Why do I act like a clueless fool?

I destroy your beauty,
Cut, Poison and Burn you down,
When I know unlike me,
You will be the one, my lineage will forever have around.

I torture you,
And your precious living beings,
Cage them, like I am the most powerful,
When I am just a mortal being.

In a heartbeat, you can take this 
Priviledge of mine, called life
Yet, you bear it all with patience,
And support with everything, to keep me alive.

What an absolute irony,I am killing the one,
Without whom I stand no chance in the cold space,
Speak of a slow suicide,
This is the best way.
