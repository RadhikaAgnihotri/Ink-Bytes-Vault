From curious about machine learning,
To grasping all the technical terms,
From stumbling on numericals,
To contemplating about models, I affirm.
 
I want to be a data scientist,
I want to be cool,
Make machines do human's work,
Make humans feel like fools.

I will gather data,
Reading until it speaks to me.
Like a night sky, vast and free,
Ideas fall like apples from a tree.

I repeat, oh universe,
Make me a scientist of data,
And I will dedicate a model to you.
I will study your mysteries,
You are free to fall in love with me too.

I have fallen for the tables,
The information, the intersection of rows and columns hold,
Will I ever make a model,
Or will my stories remain untold?

The Python wrapped around my neck,
My heartbeat's matplotlib a sleeping line,
I got the model wrong, made a wreck,
I know I will make it work this time

The toil of my eyes,             ##toil going through data
And that story on PowerBI,
Once it makes sense, we can have an apple pie,
till then you better know it all about numpy

I am trying to gain the skillset God,
Please be patient with me,
I know my resume won't get short-listed,
My interviewer would want to forget me

I have taken up the courses,
They thrill me more than Thriller,
I hope I finish them in time,
Or my dreams, flush down my tear-river

I did it,
My interview went well,
Up until now, I didn't know,
I could accomplish this as well?

I am a data scientist,
As curious as a child,
The model I will create next,
Is my own way of life.

Oh God, this feels so good,
I feel like having some power,
I want to use it for the good,
for our human cadre
