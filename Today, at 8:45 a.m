#The idea is to bring a shift in our vibrations at 8:45 in the morning because, this time seems to me
as a time when it is neither too late or too early to make that change fo rthe day,
Like I don't want you to be worried right when you wake up about having to drop all the negativity and 
Step into a high vibration, positive zone[but in reality you think you haven't given time to your
negative thoughts, so you are worried again] But this clearly doesn't mean that you can't do it early
You always can! As early as Now!
