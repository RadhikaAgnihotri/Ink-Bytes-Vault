The idea is to bring a shift in our vibrations at 8:45 in the morning because, this time seems to me
as a time when it is neither too late or too early to make that change fo rthe day,
Like I don't want you to be worried right when you wake up about having to drop all the negativity and 
Step into a high vibration, positive zone[but in reality you think you haven't given time to your
negative thoughts, so you are worried again] But this clearly doesn't mean that you can't do it early
You always can! As early as Now! 


I am sad now, I think I'm hurting myself,
But tomorrow I'll change, and read something from that shelf.
I notice it's titled, "Why the World is a Sham,"
I make a mental note, to read it all, tomorrow at 8:45 a.m.

Let her be crazy, let her be mad,
Until her inner tune burns her to ash.
She'll know it's still all within her;
She must be willing to step into the world,
Leaving behind those moments confined.
She must be there at quarter to nine
